# Sample Unity Physics


A sample Unity (2020.1.2f1) project that shows

- Essential physics concepts in Unity
- [C# inheritance](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/inheritance) with base and child classes
- Basic use of the URP (Universal Render Pipeline)





## HelloDavidson

A Hello World! for basic physics in game engines. Just press play!

- What happens when you move the RigidBody from a letter to its individual cubes?
- What happens when you turn the Fish GameObject on while the game is running?







## Movement_Basic

![hello](Assets/Movement_Basic/Textures/screenshot.png)

Examples of common methods for moving GameObjects in Unity. See the class reference sheets on movement with [transform.position](https://github.com/omundy/dig250-game-art-dev/blob/master/reference-sheets/Unity-Vectors) and [physics](https://github.com/omundy/dig250-game-art-dev/blob/master/reference-sheets/Unity-Physics.md) for more details.

- CubesTranslate
    - Four examples using `transform.Translate()` to "teleport" GameObject position.
    - Controlling transform directly is fine for simple movement but all physics interactions (collisions, etc.) will not work as expected.
- CubesMovePosition
    - Four examples using `Rigidbody.MovePosition()`
    - This method manipulates `transform.position` inside `FixedUpdate()`, but calculates collision (mostly) along the way.
- CubesAddforce
    - Four examples using `AddForce()`.

## URP (Universal Render Pipeline)

You can create a URP project using an option inside Unity Hub. When [converting from legacy rendering](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.1/manual/InstallURPIntoAProject.html) to URP:

- Install URP Package
- Create URP asset and add to graphics settings
- Camera - Check rendering settings
- Scene - Use Lighting Settings
- Ensure all your materials use [URP shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@7.1/manual/upgrading-your-shaders.html)
